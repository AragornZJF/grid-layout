## Example

### Simple Examples

#### Defining a Grid

To define a grid use new values of the display property `grid` or `inline-grid`. You can then create column and row tracks. Read the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#track-sizing).

#### Line-based placement

Positioning items on the grid using line numbers. Read the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#line-placement).

#### Line-based placement shorthand - grid-row and grid-column

Positioning items on the grid using the shorthand properties. We can achieve the same result as in example 2 using a shorthand syntax declaring the start and end values at once. Values are separated with a `/` and again it would be valid to omit the `/` and the end value as we are spanning only one track. The order of the values is `row-start/row-end` or `column-start/column-end`. Read the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#placement-shorthands)

#### Line-based placement shorthand - grid-row and grid-column

Positioning items on the grid using the shorthand properties. We can achieve the same result as in example 2 and 3 declaring all four values with the `grid-area` property. Again values are separated with a `/`. The order of the values is `row-start/column-start/row-end/column-end`. Read the [specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#placement-shorthands).
